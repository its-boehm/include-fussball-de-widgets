A WordPress plugin for easy integration of fussball.de widgets.

== Description ==

A WordPress plugin for the easy integration of the [fussball.de widgets](https://training-service.fussball.de/vereinsmitarbeiter/pressesprecherin/artikel/?tx_meinfussball_pi1%5Bmeinfussball%5D=1911#!/).

Integrate the fussball.de widgets with the help of one of the three helpers

- the classic [shortcode](https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/shortcodes/),
- as [WordPress widget](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/manage-wordpress-widgets/),
- or as [Gutenberg Block](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/block-based-widgets-editor/).

All three variants are supported. For the "old" widgets from [fussball.de](https://fussball.de) and the new type from [next.fussball.de](https://next.fussball.de). The integration process is almost identical for both types.

== Installation ==

1. Install the Fussball.de widget either via the WordPress.org plugin directory or by uploading the files to your server.
1. Activate the plugin via the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
1. You can use the plugin in several ways. As a shortcode, WordPress widget and also as an integrated Gutenberg block.
   1. Use the following shortcode
      1. For the old version: `[fubade api="{32-digit API}" notice="{Note}" fullWidth={iframe in full width} devtools={output of DevTools}]` e.g. `[fubade api="020EXXXXXG000000VS54XXXXXSGIXXME" notice="Standings U19" fullWidth=true devtools=false]`
      1. For the new variant: `[fubade api="{36-digit data-id}" type="{data-type}" notice="{note}" fullWidth={iframe in full width} devtools={output of DevTools}]` e.g. `[fubade api="299e1496-abcd-abcd-1234-8880c7270477" notice="Standings U19" fullWidth=true devtools=false]`
   1. Use the Gutenberg block with the search pattern `/fubade`.
   1. The usual WordPress widgets are also possible.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where can I get the website key (old version) =

You can get the required key from fussball.de in your widgets (<https://www.fussball.de/account.admin.widgets>). In the overview of your widget you will find the item `Website key`. This is the required character string.

= Where do I get the necessary information (new variant) =

You can obtain the required data from next.fussball.de in your widgets (<https://next.fussball.de/widgets>). There you click on the button "to widget". Then click on "Show code" in the left column. The lower code block contains the necessary information. For example like this:

`
<div
  class="fussballde_widget"
  data-id="299e1496-abcd-abcd-1234-8880c7270477"
  data-type="table"
/>
`

= How should I write the shortcode (old variant) =

Like this: `[fubade api="{32-digit API}" notice="{Note}" fullWidth={iframe in full width} devtools={output of the DevTools}]`
e.g. like this: `[fubade api="020EXXXXXG000000VS54XXXXXSGIXXME" notice="Standings U19" fullWidth=true devtools=false]`
The fields "notice", "fullWidth" and "devtools" are optional and do not have to be set.

= How should I write the shortcode (new variant) =

Like this: `[fubade api="{36-digit data-id}" type="{data-type}" notice="{notice}" fullWidth={iframe in full width} devtools={output of the DevTools}]`
e.g.`[fubade api="299e1496-abcd-abcd-1234-8880c7270477" type="table" notice="Standings U19" fullWidth=true devtools=false]`
The fields "notice", "fullWidth" and "devtools" are optional and do not have to be set.

= What is the `api` (old: `{32-digit API}`) =

The 32-digit ID (the website key) from the official Fußball.de widget must be entered here.
**The API is required.**

= What is the `api` (new: `{36-digit data-id}`) =

The 36-digit ID (found as `data-id`) from the official Fußball.de widget must be entered here.
**The API is required.**

= What is the `type` (only new: `{data-type}`) =

The 36-digit ID (found as `data-id`) from the official Fußball.de widget must be entered here.
**The TYPE is only available for the new widget. It is required there.**

= What is `classes` as space-separated `{CSS classes}`? =

You can add your own CSS classes to each widget to design it manually. For example, a fixed height or something similar can be set.
**The CSS CLASSES are optional and can be omitted.**

= What is the `notice` as `{note}`? =

The description can be entered according to your own wishes.
**NOTE is optional and can be omitted.**

= What is the `fullWidth` as `{iframe in full width}` =

The IFRAME IN FULL WIDTH can be set to the full width of 100% for the parent element.
Only `true` or `1` are possible as values.
The default value is `false` or `0`.
**IFRAME IN FULL WIDTH is optional and can be omitted.**

= What is the `devtools` as `{output of the DevTools}`? =

The PRINT DEVTOOLS can help the creator to retrieve debugging information.
Only `true` or `1` are possible as values.
The default value is `false` or `0`.
**DEVTOOLS output is optional and can be omitted.**

= What can I do if the plugin does not work =

The first point of reference should always be the [official support forum on wordpress.org](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/include-fussball-de-widgets) or also the [problem area on GitHub](https://github.com/mheob/include-fussball-de-widgets/issues).

The wrong quotation marks are also often used. The normal `"` character must be used here.

The curly brackets from my examples above should only indicate placeholders. These are also often inserted with which is not correct.

= How can I participate in the development? =

The latest state of development is available at any time in my [GitHub repository](https://github.com/mheob/include-fussball-de-widgets/). Look around there.
