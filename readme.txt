A WordPress plugin for easy integration of fussball.de widgets.

== Description ==
A WordPress plugin for easy integration of [fussball.de widgets](http://training-service.fussball.de/vereinsmitarbeiter/pressesprecherin/artikel/?tx_meinfussball_pi1%5Bmeinfussball%5D=1911&cHash=8e54ad110b258ac9679d70637b4ff796).

== Installation ==
1. Install the Fussball.de Widget either via the WordPress.org plugin directory, or by uploading the files to your server.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
1. You can use the plugin in several ways. As a shortcode, WordPress widget and since WordPress version 5 also as an integrated Gutenberg block.
   1. In wordpress versions below 5 use the shortcode like:
      `[fubade api="{32-digit API}" notice="{description}" fullwidth={iframe in fullwidth} devtools={print devtools}]`
      e.g. `[fubade api="020EXXXXXG000000VS54XXXXXSGIXXME" notice="Standings U19" fullwidth=true devtools=false]`
   1. In versions since 5.0, you can use the Gutenberg block. You can find it under the widgets or with the search pattern `fubade`.
   1. Even the usual WordPress widgets are possible.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= How should I write the shortcode? =

`[fubade api="{32-digit API}" notice="{description}" fullwidth={iframe in fullwidth} devtools={print devtools}]`
e.g. like:
`[fubade api="020EXXXXXG000000VS54XXXXXSGIXXME" notice="Standings U19" fullwidth=true devtools=false]`

= What is the `api` as `{32-digit API}`? =

Here the 32-digit ID must be entered from the official Fußball.de-Widget.
**The API is required.**

= What is the `notice` as `{description}`? =

The description can be entered according to your own wishes.
**The NOTICE is optional and can be omitted.**

= What is the `fullwidth` as `{iframe in fullwidth}`? =

The IFRAME WIDTH can be set to the full width of 100% to the parent element.
As values are only `true` or `1` possible.
The default value ist `false` or rather `0`.
**The IFRAME WIDTH is optional and can be omitted.**

= What is the `devtools` as `{print devtools}`? =

The PRINT DEVTOOLS can help the creator to get debugging information.
As values are only `true` or `1` possible.
The default value ist `false` or rather `0`.
**The PRINT DEVTOOLS is optional and can be omitted.**

= Where can I get the official ID? =

You can get the required ID when you are at fussball.de at your widgets (<https://www.fussball.de/account.admin.widgets>). In the overview of your widget you find the point `Website-Schlüssel`. This is the needed string.

= What can I do if the plugin does not work? =

The first clue should always be the [official support forum at wordpress.org](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/include-fussball-de-widgets) or the [Issues section on Github](https://github.com/mheob/include-fussball-de-widgets/issues).

Likewise and often the wrong quotes are used. It is essential to use the normal `"` sign.

The curly braces from my examples above should only show placeholders. These are also included, which is not correct.

= How can I participate in the development? =

The latest state of development is available at any time in my [Github repository](https://github.com/mheob/include-fussball-de-widgets/). Look around there.

= Support of other plugins =

This plugin support Borlabs Cookie since its version 2.0.
